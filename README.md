# LM Studio - Hugging Face Model Manager

A command-line utility to seamlessly manage and synchronize machine learning models between your Hugging Face cache and LM Studio. This tool simplifies the process of importing, exporting, and maintaining models across both platforms.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Synchronization:** Effortlessly sync models in both directionsâ€”from Hugging Face to LM Studio and from LM Studio to Hugging Face.
- **Interactive Model Selection:** A user-friendly interface to browse and select models for synchronization. It works on both UNIX-like systems and Windows.
- **Space-Efficient:** Uses symbolic links to import and export models, saving significant disk space by avoiding file duplication.
- **Smart Model Discovery:** Automatically detects models in your Hugging Face and LM Studio directories.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Customize cache directories using command-line arguments or environment variables.
- **Dry Run Mode:** Preview all file operations without making any actual changes to your system.
- **Verbose Logging:** Enable detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- LM Studio installed
- Hugging Face models downloaded locally

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/lmstudio_hf.git
    cd lmstudio_hf
    ```

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python lmstudio_hf.py
```

### Command-Line Options

- `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run to preview operations.
- `--hf-cache-dir`: Specify a custom Hugging Face cache directory.
- `--lm-studio-dir`: Specify a custom LM Studio models directory.
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose (debug) logging.

### Environment Variables

- `HF_HOME`: Custom Hugging Face cache location.
- `XDG_CACHE_HOME`: Base directory for the cache on Linux.
- `LMSTUDIO_HOME`: Custom LM Studio models directory.

## How It Works

The script scans both the Hugging Face and LM Studio model directories to identify all available models. It then presents an interactive list for you to select which models to sync.

- **Hugging Face to LM Studio:** When you select a model from your Hugging Face cache, the script creates symbolic links to it in your LM Studio models directory. If a model is already present, you can choose to remove it.
- **LM Studio to Hugging Face:** When you select a local model from LM Studio, the script fetches its metadata from the Hugging Face Hub, creates the necessary directory structure in your Hugging Face cache, and creates symbolic links to the model files. If a model is already present in the Hugging Face cache, you can choose to remove it and re-sync.
